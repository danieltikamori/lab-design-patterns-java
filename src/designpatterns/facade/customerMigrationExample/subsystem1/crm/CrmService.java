//The code you provided is for a Java class named CrmService that is part of a customer migration example using the facade design pattern. The CrmService class has a private constructor and a static method called recordCustomer that takes several parameters related to customer information. This method is used to create a customer record in the CRM system.
//Here's a breakdown of the code:
//Package Declaration:
//        package designpatterns.facade.customerMigrationExample.subsystem1.crm;
//This line specifies that the CrmService class is part of the crm subpackage within the subsystem1 package, which is part of a larger package named designpatterns.facade.customerMigrationExample.
//Class Declaration:
//public class CrmService {
//    This declares a public class named CrmService.
//    Private Constructor:
//    private CrmService(){
//        super();
//    }
//    This is a private constructor for the CrmService class. It prevents the creation of instances of this class from outside the class itself. This is a common practice when using the facade design pattern to ensure that the facade class is the only way to access the subsystem classes.
//    Static Method:
//    public static void recordCustomer(String customerName, String customerEmail, String customerPhoneNumber, String zipCode, String customerCountry, String customerState, String customerCity){
//        This is a public static method named recordCustomer that takes seven parameters:
//        customerName: The name of the customer.
//                customerEmail: The email address of the customer.
//        customerPhoneNumber: The phone number of the customer.
//        zipCode: The zip code of the customer's address.
//        customerCountry: The country of the customer's address.
//        customerState: The state of the customer's address.
//        customerCity: The city of the customer's address.
//        This method is used to create a customer record in the CRM system. It prints a message indicating that the customer record has been created successfully.
//                Method Body:
//        System.out.println("Customer record created successfully for: "+customerName);
//        This line prints a message to the console indicating that the customer record has been created successfully, along with the name of the customer.
//        Overall, the CrmService class is a simple example of a subsystem class that is used to perform a specific task (in this case, creating a customer record in a CRM system) as part of a larger customer migration process. The facade design pattern is used to provide a simplified interface to this subsystem, allowing clients to interact with it more easily.
